    <h1>ADVANTAGES OF ONLINE BANKING</h1>
  </header>

    <div class="layout">
      <p>
        Convenience: One of the most significant advantages is the convenience
        it offers. Customers can access their bank accounts, make transactions,
        and manage their finances from anywhere with an internet connection, at
        any time of the day or night.
      </p>
      <p>
        24/7 Access: Unlike traditional banking, which operates within specific
        hours, online banking provides round-the-clock access to account
        information and services. This flexibility is particularly beneficial
        for people with busy schedules or those who live in different time
        zones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Efficiency: Online banking streamlines many banking processes, such as
        transferring funds between accounts, paying bills, or applying for
        loans. Transactions that may have taken hours or days to complete
        through traditional methods can now be done within minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Financial Management Tools: Many online banking platforms offer tools
        and features to help customers track their spending, set budgets, and
        analyze their financial habits. These tools can empower individuals to
        make more informed decisions about their money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enhanced Security: While security concerns exist with any online
        activity, most banks invest heavily in security measures to protect
        their customers' information and transactions. Features like encryption,
        multi-factor authentication, and monitoring systems help safeguard
        against fraud and unauthorized access.
