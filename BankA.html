    <h1>How to Open a Bank Account</h1>
    <div class="layout">
      <p>
        Opening a bank account involves several key steps to ensure you choose
        the right bank and type of account for your financial needs. Please
        follow the steps outlined below to open an account successfully:
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Choose Your Bank</h2>
      <p>
        Research different banks to find one that offers the features and
        benefits you need, such as interest rates, minimum balance requirements,
        online banking options, and branch network.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Visit the Bank's Website or Branch</h2>
      <p>You can open an account online or by visiting a physical branch.</p>

      <h2>Step 3: Select Your Account Type</h2>
      <p>
        Banks offer various accounts, including savings accounts, current
        accounts, and fixed deposit accounts. Choose the one that best suits
        your needs.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 4: Complete the Application Form</h2>
      <p>
        Provide your personal details like name, address, date of birth, and
        contact information. You'll also need to choose a username and password
        for online banking (if applicable).
      </p>

      <h2>Step 5: Submit KYC Documents</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Aadhaar Card (simplifies the process by providing both proofs)</li>
        <li>Passport</li>
        <li>PAN Card</li>
        <li>Voter ID Card</li>
        <li>Driving License</li>
        <li>Utility Bills (for address proof)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 6: Complete KYC Verification (if online account opening)</h2>
      <p>
        Some banks may require a video KYC verification process where you'll
        have a video call with a bank representative to confirm your identity.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 7: Initial Deposit</h2>
      <p>
        Most banks require an initial deposit to activate your account. The
        minimum amount can vary depending on the bank and account type.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 8: Receive Account Details</h2>
      <p>
        Once your application is approved, the bank will provide you with your
        account number, customer ID, and details for accessing online banking
        (if applicable). You'll also receive your debit card within a few days.
      </p>

      <h3>Additional Tips:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Compare charges associated with different accounts before choosing
          one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read the terms and conditions carefully before submitting your
          application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider using an online account opening for a faster and more
          convenient experience (offered by many banks).
