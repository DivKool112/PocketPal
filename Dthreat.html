      <h2>Courier Scam Advisory</h2>
      <p class="BodyText">
        an alert SMS or email comes out of the blue from an unknown number or
        address, notifying the target that they have missed a delivery and that
        it will need to be re-arranged with the courier. These typically
        reference the largest of the local delivery and courier companies or
        even the central mailing services within the attack region. When the
        victim follows the link to re-arrange their fake delivery, they are
        asked for a host of personal information including credit card details
        to cover a fee for redelivery. These scams are very successful
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="BodyText">
            Your bank or the police will never call you to ask you to verify
            your personal details or PIN by phone or offer to pick up your card
            by courier. Hang up if you get a call like this.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="BodyText">
            If you need to call your bank back to check, wait five minutes;
            fraudsters may stay on the line after you hang up.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="BodyText">
        Alternatively, use a different line altogether to call your bank.
      </p>
      <p class="BodyText">
        If you believe you've fallen for a scam, contact your bank immediately
        on a number you know to be correct, such as the one listed on your
        statement, their website or on the back of your debit or credit card.
      </p>
      <h2>Part-time Job Scam Alert</h2>
      <p class="BodyText">
        Alarming surge in messages from international numbers offering enticing
        part-time job opportunities has become a cause for concern. These
        messages claim to be from marketing companies looking to boost their
        clients' ratings on platforms like Google Maps and other marketplaces.
        The seemingly straightforward offer of earning 50 rupees per review may
        sound appealing, but behind the facade lies a well-orchestrated scam
        that preys on unsuspecting individuals.
      </p>
      <p class="BodyText">
        To evade tracking, the victim is urged to join a Telegram group. This is
        a red flag, as scammers often prefer communication channels that are
        harder to trace.
      </p>
      <p class="BodyText">
        The victim is then asked to provide their bank details for the purported
        money deposits. To build trust, a small amount, such as 150 rupees, may
        be deposited initially.
      </p>
      <h3>Tips to Stay Safe:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="BodyText">
            Research thoroughly: Before applying, research the company and the
            specific job title. Look for red flags mentioned above.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="BodyText">
            Verify the company: Check the company's website, social media
            presence, and online reviews from employees or customers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="BodyText">
            Beware of pressure: Legitimate employers won't pressure you to make
            a quick decision or provide immediate personal information.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="BodyText">
            Never pay upfront: If a company asks for any kind of payment before
            hiring you, it's a scam.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="BodyText">
            Speak with the employer: Try to schedule a call or video chat with
            the employer to confirm their legitimacy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="BodyText">
            Use trusted job boards: Look for remote work opportunities on
            reputable job boards with established anti-fraud measures.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Investment Scam Warning: Unrealistic Returns Ahead</h3>
      <p class="BodyText">
        Investment fraud happens when people try to trick you into investing
        money. They might want you to invest money in stocks, bonds, notes,
        commodities, currency, or even real estate. A scammer may lie to you or
        give you fake information about a real investment. Or they may make up a
        fake investment opportunity.
      </p>
      <p class="BodyText">
        Investment fraudsters might say they are telemarketers or financial
        advisors. They seem smart, friendly, and charming. They may tell you an
        investment opportunity is urgent. They try to earn your trust so you
        will give them money as quickly as possible and without asking many
        questions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="BodyText">
            Always validate an investment by calling the institution you are
            investing with on an independent number, not one found in the body
            of an email. You can find a company's number on the FCA register.
            Online research may not be enough to uncover sophisticated scams.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="BodyText">
        Always pay full attention to fraud warnings when making a payment: they
        are there for your safety
      </p>
      <p class="BodyText">QR Code Scam Alert</p>
      <p class="BodyText">
        The scam starts with someone putting an item on an online sale website.
        That's when the fraudsters pose as buyers and share the QR code to pay
        an advance or token amount. They then create a QR code and share it with
        the intended victim through WhatsApp or email. They will ask the victim
        to scan the QR code sent by them so that they will receive the money
        directly into their bank accounts. Believing them, the victims scan QR
        codes sent by the fraudsters presuming that they will receive the money
        in their account but they end up losing money.
      </p>
      <p class="BodyText">
        To identify scams, firstly users should know that QR code is only
        scanned to send money and not to receive money.
      </p>
      <p class="BodyText">
        Another important practice is to inspect the URL or website linked to
        the QR code. Ensure that it begins with "https://" to indicate a secure
        connection, and be wary of misspellings or suspicious variations in the
        domain name.
      </p>
      <p class="BodyText">
        Avoid sharing UPI IDs and bank details with strangers, verify online
        transactions, and exercise caution with suspicious QR codes
      </p>
      <h2>Digital Banking and Credit Card Frauds</h2>
      <p class="BodyText">
        Digital bank fraud occurs when criminals gain unauthorized access to
        personal or financial information through various means. One common
        method is through phishing emails, where fraudsters pose as legitimate
        institutions and request sensitive information, such as login
        credentials, from unsuspecting victims.
      </p>
      <p class="BodyText">
        Use strong, unique passwords and update them regularly.
      </p>
      <p class="BodyText">
        Activate two-factor authentication for added security.
      </p>
      <h3>Skimming</h3>
      <p class="BodyText">
        happens when a thief steals a customer's credit card details during a
        legitimate transaction at a PoS device and uses that information to
        design a counterfeit card. Using this card, the thief can make online
        purchases where a physical card is unnecessary. Never let your card out
        of sight while handing it over to the operator at restaurants or at fuel
        stations. EVM chip cards help alleviate the skimming problem, but
        customers should immediately alert the staff if they see anything
        unusual in the card slot ll credit card providers have a facility to set
        payment limits for ATM withdrawals, PoS transactions, online/e-commerce
        payments, and contactless payments. By default, the limit is set to the
        maximum amount available on the card. It is best to change these
        settings to the minimum amount you need in day-to-day transactions. You
        can change the limit from the mobile application anytime.
