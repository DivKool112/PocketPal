    <h1>BONDS</h1>
    <p>
      Bonds are fixed-income securities issued by governments, corporations, or
      other entities to raise capital. When investors buy bonds, they are
      essentially lending money to the bond issuer in exchange for periodic
      interest payments (coupons) and the return of the principal amount at
      maturity
