    <p class="BodyText">
      <span>Personal finance:</span>refers to the management of an individual's
      or household's financial resources, including income, expenses, savings,
      investments, and financial goals. It involves making informed decisions
      about earning, spending, saving, and investing money to achieve financial
      stability.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyText">
      <span>Budgeting</span>is the process of creating a detailed plan for
      managing income and expenses over a specific period, typically monthly or
      annually. It involves estimating income from all sources and allocating
      funds to various expense categories based on priorities, financial goals,
      and available resources.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="BodyText">So what are the elements of a budget?</p>
    <p class="BodyText">
      Income: It refers to the money received for the hard work you have done.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="BodyText">Why do we need income?</p>
    <p class="BodyText">
      We need income because it's the money we earn from our work or investments
      that allows us to pay for things we need and want in life. Income helps us
      buy food, pay for a place to live, cover our bills, and enjoy activities
      like going out with friends or taking vacations. It's like the fuel that
      keeps our lives running smoothly, helping us meet our daily needs and
      achieve our goals.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyText">An individual may have several sources of income:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="BodyText">Wages/Salary earned from a job</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="BodyText">Self-employment income earned from ones own business</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="BodyText">Interest earned from savings a/c in bank</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="BodyText">Rent earned from a property</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="BodyText">Earnings from any investments made in stocks and bonds</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p class="BodyText">
      It is important to have more than one source of income. If one source of
      income suddenly dries up or becomes unreliable, you can still rely on
      other methods to sustain yourself financially.
    </p>
    <h1>Types of income:</h1>
    <p class="BodyText">
      Active income - Active income is money you earn by actively trading your
      time, skills, or expertise for payment. It's the income you receive from
      working a job, providing services, or running a business where you're
      directly involved in the day-to-day operations.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyText">
      For example, if you work a regular 9-to-5 job, the salary or wages you
      earn from that job is considered active income. Essentially, active income
      requires ongoing effort and time investment to generate. Imagine you have
      a job at a local bakery. Every day, you go to work and spend your time
      baking delicious cakes, pastries, and bread. In return for your time and
      effort, your boss pays you a salary or wages. This money you receive from
      working at the bakery is an example of active income. To continue earning
      income, you need to keep working at the bakery. As long as you're actively
      working and contributing your time and skills, you'll receive your
      paycheck.

    <p class="BodyText">
      Passive income - Passive income, is money you earn with little to no
      active involvement or effort on your part. It's income that continues to
      flow in even when you're not actively working. The key distinction with
      passive income is that once you've set up the income stream, it continues
      to generate money without requiring constant time or effort from you.
    </p>
    <div class="sec2">
      <img src="img4.png" height="200" width="200" />
      <p class="BodyText">
        Imagine you own a rental property, like an apartment or a house. You've
        rented out the property to a tenant, who pays you rent every month. The
        money you receive from the rent is an example of passive income. Each
        month, your tenant pays you rent for living in the property. While you
        may need to handle occasional maintenance issues or communicate with
        your tenant, the day-to-day management of the property doesn't require
        constant active involvement from you. This money flows to you regularly,
        providing a steady stream of income without requiring you to actively
        work for it.
