    <h1>CryptoCurrency</h1>
    <p>
      What is Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a type of digital or virtual
      currency that uses cryptography for secure transactions and to control the
      creation of new units. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments
      (such as dollars or euros), cryptocurrencies operate independently of any
      central authority or government.

      Why was it introduced? Cryptocurrency was introduced as a decentralised
      alternative to traditional forms of money. It was created to address some
      of the limitations and shortcomings of traditional banking and financial
      systems, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Centralization</span>Traditional banking systems are
          centralised, meaning they are controlled by a single authority, such
          as a government or central bank. Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is
          decentralised, meaning it is not controlled by any single entity. This
          decentralisation aims to eliminate the need for intermediaries, reduce
          the risk of censorship or manipulation, and give users more control
          over their money.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Global Accessibility</span>Cryptocurrency transactions can be
          conducted globally, without the need for traditional banking
          infrastructure or intermediaries. This enables fast and low-cost
          cross-border transactions, making cryptocurrency particularly useful
          for remittances and international payments.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Financial Inclusion</span>Cryptocurrency has the potential to
          provide access to financial services for individuals who are
          underserved or excluded by traditional banking systems. Anyone with
          internet access can participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem,
          regardless of their location or socioeconomic status.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Inflation Resistance</span>Central banks have the authority to
          control the value of traditional currencies by adjusting interest
          rates, implementing quantitative easing measures, or printing more
          money. Unlike traditional currencies, which are controlled by central
          authorities like governments or central banks, cryptocurrencies
          operate on decentralized networks powered by blockchain technology.
          For example, Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins.

      <p>However, it still has certain disadvantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span> Irreversible Transactions:</span>Cryptocurrency transactions
            are irreversible once executed, unlike traditional banking
            transactions that can be cancelled or reversed. Users must exercise
            caution to avoid mistakes or fraudulent transactions, as there's no
            recourse for recovering lost funds. Unlike traditional banking
            transactions, where financial institutions act as intermediaries and
            can reverse transactions under certain circumstances (such as in
            cases of fraud or error), cryptocurrency transactions don't involve
            intermediaries. Instead, they are peer-to-peer transactions between
            anonymous users. For example, if you accidentally send
            cryptocurrency to the wrong wallet address, there's no way to
            retrieve the funds because you don't have any personal information
            about the recipient, and they don't have any information about you.

            <span> Volatility in Value:</span>Cryptocurrency values can be
            highly volatile, experiencing significant fluctuations in price over
            short periods. Unlike traditional currencies, which are backed by
            governments, cryptocurrency values are determined by market demand
            and speculation, leading to price instability.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span> Not a legal tender:</span> Legal tender status means that a
            currency is officially recognized and accepted as a medium of
            exchange for goods, services, and debts within a country's
            jurisdiction. While cryptocurrencies can be used as a medium of
            exchange in some cases, they lack legal tender status. This means
            that businesses and individuals are not required to accept
            cryptocurrencies as payment, and there may be limited acceptance or
            infrastructure for using cryptocurrencies in everyday transactions.
            As a result, cryptocurrency users may face challenges in finding
            merchants or service providers willing to accept cryptocurrency
            payments, limiting its practical utility as a form of currency for
            day-to-day transactions.
