      <p>Advantages</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Potential for High Returns: Stocks can provide higher average
            returns compared to other investment methods such as FDs when
            invested in the right companies over the long term.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Diversification: Stock market investing allows investors to
            diversify their portfolios across different industries, sectors, and
            geographic regions. Diversification helps spread risk and minimise
            the impact of poor performance in any single stock or sector on the
            overall portfolio.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Liquidity: Stocks are highly liquid investments, meaning they can be
            bought or sold quickly on public stock exchanges during trading
            hours. Dividend Income: Many publicly traded companies distribute a
            portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends.

      <p>Disadvantages</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Market Volatility: Prices fluctuate daily in response to various
            factors such as economic conditions, corporate earnings,
            geopolitical events, and investor sentiment. Market volatility can
            lead to significant short-term price swings and uncertainty,
            potentially causing panic among investors.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Risk of Loss: Investing in stocks carries the risk of losing
            capital, especially in the short term. Stock prices can be
            influenced by unpredictable factors, including market speculation,
            company-specific issues, regulatory changes, and external shocks.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Emotional Investing: Stock market investing can evoke emotions such
            as fear, greed, and overconfidence, leading to impulsive
            decision-making and irrational behavior.
