        <p>
          <span>Sales Tax: </span>Sales tax is a consumption tax levied on the
          sale of goods and services. It is typically a percentage of the retail
          price of the item being purchased. Sales tax is collected by the
          seller and then remitted to the government.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Value Added Tax (VAT): </span>VAT, or commercial tax, is imposed
          at all supply chain stages, excluding zero-rated items like food and
          essential drugs. VAT is imposed by state governments, each determining
          its own tax rates on goods sold within the state.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Customs Duty and Octroi: </span>Customs duty is applied to
          imported goods, ensuring taxation on products entering the country.
          Octroi, imposed by state governments, serves a similar purpose but
          focuses on goods crossing state borders within India.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Excise Duty: </span>Excise duty, also known as Central Value
          Added Tax (CENVAT), is imposed on manufactured goods in India. It
          differs from customs duty as it applies only to domestically produced
          goods. The Central Excise Rule mandates payment of duty on excisable
          goods, restricting their movement without duty payment from the
          manufacturing point.
        </p>

      allowing salaried taxpayers to avail of an upfront deduction of INR 50,000
      from their total taxable income, which was previously only available under
